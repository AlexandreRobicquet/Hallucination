## Requirements

## 

get the right data

```unix
mkdir data
cd data
```

download

http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-16.mat

```unix
wget http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-16.mat
```

http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat

New dataset coming

Really important to also get cuDNN for Lasagne


### Cuda

Really important to have well install:

### Pylearn2 

#### Installation

There is no PyPI download yet, so Pylearn2 cannot be installed using e.g. pip. You must check out the bleeding-edge/development version from GitHub using:
```unix
git clone git://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2.git
```

To make Pylearn2 available in your Python installation, run the following command in the top-level pylearn2 directory (which should have been created by the previous command):

```unix
python setup.py develop
```
You may need to use sudo to invoke this command with administrator privileges. If you do not have such access (or would rather not add Pylearn2 to the global site-packages for whatever reason), you can install the relevant links inside the user site-packages directory by issuing the command:
```unix
python setup.py develop --user
```
This command will also compile the Cython extensions required for e.g. pylearn2.train_extensions.window_flip.
Alternatively, you can make Pylearn2 available by adding the installation directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable, but note that changing
your PYTHONPATH alone wonâ€™t compile the Cython extensions (you will need to make sure the extension .so files are built and accessible within the source t
ree, e.g. with python setup.py build_ext --inplace).

#### Path adding

For some tutorials and tests you will also need to set your PYLEARN2_DATA_PATH variable. On Linux, the best way to do this is to add a line to your ~/.bashrc file:
```unix
export PYLEARN2_DATA_PATH=/data/lisa/data
```
Note that this is only an example, and if you are not in the LISA lab, you will need to choose a directory path that is valid on your filesystem. Simply choose a path where it will be convenient for you to store datasets for use with Pylearn2.


### Caffe (for mac OsX)

###### General dependencies

```python
brew install -vd snappy leveldb gflags glog szip lmdb
# need the homebrew science source for OpenCV and hdf5
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install homebrew/science/hdf5 #to be sure..
brew install hdf5 opencv
```
If using Anaconda Python, a modification to the OpenCV formula might be needed Do brew edit opencv and change the lines that look like the two lines below to exactly the two lines below.

```python
-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=#{py_prefix}/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=#{py_prefix}/include/python2.7
```

If using Anaconda Python, HDF5 is bundled and the hdf5 formula can be skipped.


##### Remaining dependencies, with / without Python

```unix
# with Python pycaffe needs dependencies built from source
brew install --build-from-source --with-python -vd protobuf
brew install --build-from-source -vd boost boost-python
# without Python the usual installation suffices
brew install protobuf boost
```

........ TO FINISH

# Polish the database

Once you've downloaded the vgg-verydeep-16 and 19, you will need to create the normalization batch

# Train
first create the database
```unix
python matn2py.py
```
then simply train

```unix
THEANO_FLAGS=device=gpu python train.py`

```
